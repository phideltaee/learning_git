1) to begin: write "git init" this will initialize a repository in your current folder. 
2) once that's done, write "clone https://www.github.com/phideltaee/learning_git" which will add the learnig git repository to your current folder. 
3) now, any file can be modified. This will change the current git status. 
--> If a file is changed, check it in statuts
"git status" 

4) if it is changed. You need to upload the changes. So, add it to your commits
	-> git add newfile.txt
	-> (or) git add * (to add all files)

5) To commit the changes to the repository use
	-> git commit -m "added the explanation on how to use git"
 once this is done, the file is now commited. We need to push it to the repository.
